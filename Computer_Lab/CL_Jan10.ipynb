    "Welcome to jupyter noteboks! In this exercise you'll get familiar with jupyter notebooks and the fun features they have. We'll also briefly go over some of the parts of python we'll be using during this class. It's important to note that I'm skipping over some of the main philisophical components of coding. If you're just seeing code for the first time, I don't want this to be overwhelming! I'm hoping that by only introducing what we'll be using during the class, it'll make it less intimidating. Just know that this little bit of code we'll be using represents such a tiny part of the universe of coding.\n",

    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are lovely. They let you test out code snippets without fully committing to an entire script, and documenting your code is a lot more straightforward. If you have a LaTeX compiler, you can compile them into beautiful PDFs. I use jupyter notebooks to organize my \"todo\" tasks for a day, I use them to do basic arithmetic, and I use them to visualize data. "
